##  Description
This project simulates a simplified **virtual CPU (VOLE Machine)** that can:
- Load a program from a text file.
- Decode and execute binary-like instructions.
- Use memory, registers, and an ALU for processing.
- Display the final state of memory and registers after execution.

This project was created as part of the **Cairo University â€“ Computer Science** coursework.

##  Components
- **Memory:** Stores program instructions and data.  
- **RegisterBank:** Contains general-purpose registers.  
- **ALU:** Performs arithmetic and logic operations.  
- **CU (Control Unit):** Fetches, decodes, and executes instructions.  
- **CPU:** Coordinates the execution process.  
- **VOLEMachine:** Provides a simple interface to load and run programs.
